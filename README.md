F-score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Typically, by combining precision and recall values, it assesses how well the model performs in terms of both accuracy and completeness.

Precision: Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive examples out of all instances predicted as positive.
Recall: Recall gauges the proportion of truly positive examples that the model correctly identifies.
F-score combines precision and recall values using a weighted average.

Here, the beta value adjusts the balance between precision and recall. Specifically, if (𝛽>1) it emphasizes recall more; if (𝛽<1) it emphasizes precision more. F-score measures the model's performance by striking this balance and providing a single numerical evaluation.
